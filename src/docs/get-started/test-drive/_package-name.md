{{site.alert.note}}
  When creating a new Flutter app, some Flutter IDE plugins ask for a
  company domain name in reverse order, something like `com.example`.
  The company domain name and project name are used together as the
  package name for Android (the Bundle ID for iOS) when the app is released.
  If you think that the app might be released,
  it's better to specify the package name now.
  The package name can't be changed once the app is released,
  so make the name unique.
