  The `flutter` tool uses Google Analytics to anonymously report
  feature usage statistics and basic [crash reports][]. This data is
  used to help improve Flutter tools over time.

  Flutter tool analytics are not sent on the very first run. To disable
  reporting, type `flutter config --no-analytics`. To display the current
  setting, type `flutter config`. If you opt out of analytics, an opt-out
  event is sent, and then no further information is sent by the
  Flutter tool.

  By downloading the Flutter SDK, you agree to the Google Terms of Service.
  Note: The Google [Privacy Policy][] describes how data is handled in this
  service.

  Moreover, Flutter includes the Dart SDK, which may send usage metrics and
  crash reports to Google.
