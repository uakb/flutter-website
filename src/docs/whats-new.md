For the 1.9 release, Flutter's web support has been
merged ("unforked") into the main repo.
**Web support hasn't reached beta, and is not ready
to be used in production.**

but more will be coming.

New and updated docs on the site include:

  uses the updated DartPad, the browser-based tool for
  running Dart code. DartPad now supports Flutter!
  [Try it out] and let us know what you think.
* A new page on [using the dart:ffi library][]
  to bind your app to native code (a feature currently under
  development).
* The Performance view tool, which allows you to record
  and profile a session from your Dart/Flutter application,
  has been enabled in DevTools. For more information,
  see the [Performance view][] page.
* A new page on
  [building a web application][].
* A new page on [creating responsive apps][] in Flutter.
* A new page on [preparing a web app for release][].
* A new [web FAQ][].
* The [Flutter for web][] page is updated.

Other relevant docs:

* Error messages have been improved in SDK 1.9.
  For more information, read
  [Improving Flutter's Error Messages][]
  on the [Flutter Medium publication][].
* If you already have a web app that depends on the
  flutter_web package, the following instructions tell
  you how to migrate to the flutter package:
  [Upgrading from package:flutter_web to the Flutter SDK][].
* A new [`ToggleButtons`][] widget, described in the API docs.
  [ToggleButtons demo][]
* A new [`ColorFiltered`][] widget, also described in the API docs.
  [ColorFiltered demo][]

  files for both 32-bit and 64-bit devices.

Flutter released [version 1.2][] at Mobile World Congress
(MWC) in Barcelona. For more information, see the
[1.2.1 release notes][] or [download the release][].

In addition, here are some recent new and updated docs:

* We've updated our [state management advice][].
  New pages include an [introduction][],
  [thinking declaratively][], [ephemeral vs app state][],
  [simple app state management][], and
  [different state management options].
  Documenting state management is a tricky thing, as there is no
  one-size-fits-all approach. We'd love your feedback on these new docs!
* A new page on [Performance best practices][].
* Also at MWC, we announced a preview version of the new Dart DevTools
  for profiling and debugging Dart and Flutter apps.
  You can find the docs on the DevTools wiki
  (Note: since moved to [this site][].)
  In particular, check out the DevTool's [widget inspector][] for
  debugging your UI, or the [timeline view][] for profiling your Flutter
  application. Try them out and let us know what you think!
* An update to the [Performance profiling][]
  page that incorporates the new Dart DevTools UI.
* Updates to the [Android Studio/IntelliJ][]
  and [VS Code][] pages incorporating info from
  the new Dart DevTools UI.

If you have questions or comments about any of these docs,
