If your app might be deployed to users who speak another language then
you'll need to internationalize it. That means you need to write
the app in a way that makes it possible to localize values like text
and layouts for each language or locale that the app
supports. Flutter provides widgets and classes that help with
internationalization and the Flutter libraries themselves are
internationalized.

This page covers concepts and workflows necessary to localize a
Flutter application using the `MaterialApp` and `CupertinoApp`
classes, as most apps are written that way. However, applications
written using the lower level `WidgetsApp` class can also
be internationalized using the same classes and logic.

  If you'd like to start out by reading the code for an internationalized
  Flutter app, here are two small examples. The first one is intended to
  be as simple as possible, and the second one uses the APIs and tools
  provided by the [`intl`][] package.

## Introduction to localizations in Flutter

This section provides a tutorial on how to internationalize
a Flutter application, along with any additional setup that a
target platform might require.

### Setting up an internation&shy;alized app: the Flutter<wbr>_localizations package {#setting-up}

By default, Flutter only provides US English localizations.
To add support for other languages,
an application must specify additional `MaterialApp` (or `CupertinoApp`)
properties, and include a package called
`flutter_localizations`. As of November 2020,
this package supports 78 languages.

To use flutter_localizations,
add the package as a dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

<?code-excerpt "gen_l10n_example/pubspec.yaml (FlutterLocalizations)"?>
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_localizations: # Add this line
    sdk: flutter         # Add this line
```

Next, run `pub get packages`, then import the `flutter_localizations` library and specify
`localizationsDelegates` and `supportedLocales` for `MaterialApp`:

<?code-excerpt "gen_l10n_example/lib/main.dart (LocalizationDelegatesImport)"?>
```dart
import 'package:flutter_localizations/flutter_localizations.dart';
```

<?code-excerpt "gen_l10n_example/lib/main.dart (MaterialApp)" remove="AppLocalizations.delegate"?>
```dart
return MaterialApp(
  title: 'Localizations Sample App',
  localizationsDelegates: [
    GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
    GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
    GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,
  ],
  supportedLocales: [
    const Locale('en', ''), // English, no country code
    const Locale('es', ''), // Spanish, no country code
  ],
  theme: ThemeData(
    primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
  ),
  home: MyHomePage(),
);
```

After introducing the `flutter_localizations` package
and adding the code above, the `Material` and `Cupertino`
packages should now be correctly localized in
one of the 78 supported locales. Widgets should be
adapted to the localized messages, along with
correct left-to-right and right-to-left layout.

Try switching the target platform's locale to
Spanish (`es`) and notice that the messages should
be localized.

Apps based on `WidgetsApp` are similar except that the
`GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate` isn't needed.

The full `Locale.fromSubtags` constructor is preferred
as it supports [`scriptCode`][], though the `Locale` default
constructor is still fully valid.

[`scriptCode`]: {{site.api}}/flutter/package-intl_locale/Locale/scriptCode.html

The elements of the `localizationsDelegates` list are factories that produce
collections of localized values. `GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate`
provides localized strings and other values for the Material Components
library. `GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate` defines the default
text direction, either left-to-right or right-to-left, for the widgets
library.

More information about these app properties, the types they
depend on, and how internationalized Flutter apps are typically
structured, can be found below.

<a name="adding-localized-messages"></a>
### Adding your own localized messages

Once the `flutter_localizations` package is added, use the
following instructions to add localized text to your application.

1. Add the `intl` package to the `pubspec.yaml` file:

{% comment %}
RegEx removes "# Add this line" from lines "flutter_localizations:" and "sdk: flutter"
{% endcomment %}
   <?code-excerpt "gen_l10n_example/pubspec.yaml (Intl)" replace="/(?<!0) # Add this line//g" ?>
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_localizations:
       sdk: flutter
     intl: ^0.17.0 # Add this line
   ```

2. Also, in the `pubspec.yaml` file, enable the `generate`
flag. This is added to the section of the pubspec that is
specific to Flutter, and usually comes later in the pubspec
file.

   <?code-excerpt "gen_l10n_example/pubspec.yaml (Generate)"?>
   ```yaml
   # The following section is specific to Flutter.
   flutter:
     generate: true # Add this line
   ```

3. Add a new yaml file to the root directory of the Flutter
project called `l10n.yaml` with the following content:

   <?code-excerpt "gen_l10n_example/l10n.yaml"?>
   ```yaml
   arb-dir: lib/l10n
   template-arb-file: app_en.arb
   output-localization-file: app_localizations.dart
   ```

   This file configures the localization tool; in this example,
   the input files are located in `${FLUTTER_PROJECT}/lib/l10n`,
   the `app_en.arb` file provides the template, and the generated
   localizations are placed in the `app_localizations.dart` file.

4. In `${FLUTTER_PROJECT}/lib/l10n`,
   add the `app_en.arb` template file. For example:

   <?code-excerpt "gen_l10n_example/lib/l10n/app_en.arb"?>
   ```json
   {
       "helloWorld": "Hello World!",
       "@helloWorld": {
         "description": "The conventional newborn programmer greeting"
       }
   }
   ```

5. Next, add an `app_es.arb` file in the same directory for
   Spanish translation of the same message:

   <?code-excerpt "gen_l10n_example/lib/l10n/app_es.arb"?>
   ```json
   {
       "helloWorld": "Hola Mundo!"
   }
   ```

6. Now, run your app so that codegen takes place. You should see generated files in
   `${FLUTTER_PROJECT}/.dart_tool/flutter_gen/gen_l10n`.

7. Add the import statement on `app_localizations.dart` and `AppLocalizations.delegate`
   in your call to the constructor for `MaterialApp`.

   <?code-excerpt "gen_l10n_example/lib/main.dart (AppLocalizationsImport)"?>
   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart';
   ```

   <?code-excerpt "gen_l10n_example/lib/main.dart (MaterialApp)"?>
   ```dart
   return MaterialApp(
     title: 'Localizations Sample App',
     localizationsDelegates: [
       AppLocalizations.delegate, // Add this line
       GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
       GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
       GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,
     ],
     supportedLocales: [
       const Locale('en', ''), // English, no country code
       const Locale('es', ''), // Spanish, no country code
     ],
     theme: ThemeData(
       primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
     ),
     home: MyHomePage(),
   );
   ```

8. Use AppLocalizations anywhere in your app.
   Here, the translated message is used in a Text widget.

   <?code-excerpt "gen_l10n_example/lib/examples.dart (Example)"?>
   ```dart
   Text(AppLocalizations.of(context)!.helloWorld);
   ```

9. You can also use the generated `localizationsDelegates` and `supportedLocales` list
   instead of providing them manually.

   <?code-excerpt "gen_l10n_example/lib/examples.dart (MaterialAppExample)"?>
   ```dart
   MaterialApp(
     title: 'Localizations Sample App',
     localizationsDelegates: AppLocalizations.localizationsDelegates,
     supportedLocales: AppLocalizations.supportedLocales,
   );
   ```

   This code generates a Text widget that displays "Hello World!"
   if the target device's locale is set to English, and "Hola Mundo!"
   if the target device's locale is set to Spanish. In the `arb` files,
   the key of each entry is used as the method name of the getter,
   while the value of that entry contains the localized message.

To see a sample Flutter app using this tool, please see
[`gen_l10n_example`][].

To localize your device app description, you can pass in the localized
string into [`MaterialApp.onGenerateTitle`][]:

<?code-excerpt "intl_example/lib/main.dart (MaterialAppTitleExample)"?>
```dart
return MaterialApp(
  onGenerateTitle: (BuildContext context) => DemoLocalizations.of(context).title,
```

For more information about the localization tool,
such as dealing with DateTime and handling plurals,
see the [Internationalization User's Guide][].

### Localizing for iOS: Updating the iOS app bundle

iOS applications define key application metadata,
including supported locales, in an `Info.plist` file
that is built into the application bundle.
To configure the locales supported by your app,
use the following instructions:

1. Open your project's `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` Xcode file.

2. In the **Project Navigator**, open the `Info.plist` file
   under the `Runner` project's `Runner` folder.

3. Select the **Information Property List** item.
   Then select **Add Item** from the **Editor** menu,
   and select **Localizations** from the pop-up menu.

4. Select and expand the newly-created `Localizations` item.
   For each locale your application supports,
   add a new item and select the locale you wish to add
   from the pop-up menu in the **Value** field.
   This list should be consistent with the languages listed
   in the [supportedLocales][] parameter.

5. Once all supported locales have been added, save the file.

<a name="advanced-customization">
## Advanced topics for further customization

This section covers additional ways to customize a
localized Flutter application.

<a name="advanced-locale"></a>
### Advanced locale definition

Some languages with multiple variants require more than just a
language code to properly differentiate.

For example, fully differentiating all variants of
Chinese requires specifying the language code, script code,
and country code. This is due to the existence
of simplified and traditional script, as well as regional
differences in the way characters are written within the same script type.

In order to fully express every variant of Chinese for the
country codes `CN`, `TW`, and `HK`, the list of supported
locales should include:

<?code-excerpt "gen_l10n_example/lib/examples.dart (SupportedLocales)"?>
```dart
supportedLocales: [
  const Locale.fromSubtags(languageCode: 'zh'), // generic Chinese 'zh'
  const Locale.fromSubtags(languageCode: 'zh', scriptCode: 'Hans'), // generic simplified Chinese 'zh_Hans'
  const Locale.fromSubtags(languageCode: 'zh', scriptCode: 'Hant'), // generic traditional Chinese 'zh_Hant'
  const Locale.fromSubtags(languageCode: 'zh', scriptCode: 'Hans', countryCode: 'CN'), // 'zh_Hans_CN'
  const Locale.fromSubtags(languageCode: 'zh', scriptCode: 'Hant', countryCode: 'TW'), // 'zh_Hant_TW'
  const Locale.fromSubtags(languageCode: 'zh', scriptCode: 'Hant', countryCode: 'HK'), // 'zh_Hant_HK'
],
```

This explicit full definition ensures that your app can
distinguish between and provide the fully nuanced localized
content to all combinations of these country codes.
If a user's preferred locale is not specified,
then the closest match is used instead,
which likely contains differences to what the user expects.
Flutter only resolves to locales defined in `supportedLocales`.
Flutter provides scriptCode-differentiated
localized content for commonly used languages.
See [`Localizations`][] for information on how the supported
locales and the preferred locales are resolved.

Although Chinese is a primary example,
other languages like French (`fr_FR`, `fr_CA`)
should also be fully differentiated for more nuanced localization.

<a name="tracking-locale"></a>
### Tracking the locale: The Locale class and the Localizations widget

The [`Locale`][] class identifies the user's language.
Mobile devices support setting the locale for all applications,
usually using a system settings menu.
Internationalized apps respond by displaying values that are
locale-specific. For example, if the user switches the device's locale
from English to French, then a `Text` widget that originally
displayed "Hello World" would be rebuilt with "Bonjour le monde".

The [`Localizations`][widgets-global] widget defines the locale
for its child and the localized resources that the child depends on.
The [`WidgetsApp`][] widget creates a `Localizations` widget
and rebuilds it if the system's locale changes.

You can always lookup an app's current locale with
`Localizations.localeOf()`:

<?code-excerpt "gen_l10n_example/lib/examples.dart (MyLocale)"?>
```dart
Locale myLocale = Localizations.localeOf(context);
```

<a name="specifying-supportedlocales"></a>
### Specifying the app's supported&shy;Locales parameter

Although the `flutter_localizations` library currently supports 78
languages and language variants, only English language translations
are available by default. It's up to the developer to decide exactly
which languages to support.

The `MaterialApp` [`supportedLocales`][]
parameter limits locale changes. When the user changes the locale
setting on their device, the app's `Localizations` widget only
follows suit if the new locale is a member of this list.
If an exact match for the device locale isn't found,
then the first supported locale with a matching [`languageCode`][]
is used. If that fails, then the first element of the
`supportedLocales` list is used.

An app that wants to use a different "locale resolution"
method can provide a [`localeResolutionCallback`][].
For example, to have your app unconditionally accept
whatever locale the user selects:

<?code-excerpt "gen_l10n_example/lib/examples.dart (LocaleResolution)"?>
```dart
MaterialApp(
  localeResolutionCallback: (
    Locale? locale,
    Iterable<Locale> supportedLocales,
  ) {
    return locale;
  },
);
```

## How internationalization in Flutter works

This section covers the technical details of how localizations work
in Flutter. If you're planning on supporting your own set of localized
messages, the following content would be helpful. Otherwise, you can
skip this section.

<a name="loading-and-retrieving"></a>
### Loading and retrieving localized values

The `Localizations` widget is used to load and lookup objects that
contain collections of localized values. Apps refer to these objects
with [`Localizations.of(context,type)`][].
If the device's locale changes,
the `Localizations` widget automatically loads values for
the new locale and then rebuilds widgets that used it.
This happens because `Localizations` works like an
[`InheritedWidget`][].
When a build function refers to an inherited widget,
an implicit dependency on the inherited widget is created.
When an inherited widget changes
(when the `Localizations` widget's locale changes),
its dependent contexts are rebuilt.

Localized values are loaded by the `Localizations` widget's
list of [`LocalizationsDelegate`][]s.
Each delegate must define an asynchronous [`load()`][]
method that produces an object that encapsulates a
collection of localized values.
Typically these objects define one method per localized value.

In a large app, different modules or packages might be bundled with
their own localizations. That's why the `Localizations` widget
manages a table of objects, one per `LocalizationsDelegate`.
To retrieve the object produced by one of the `LocalizationsDelegate`'s
`load` methods, you specify a `BuildContext` and the object's type.

For example,
the localized strings for the Material Components widgets
are defined by the [`MaterialLocalizations`][] class.
Instances of this class are created by a `LocalizationDelegate`
provided by the [`MaterialApp`][] class.
They can be retrieved with `Localizations.of()`:

<!-- skip -->
```dart
Localizations.of<MaterialLocalizations>(context, MaterialLocalizations);
```

This particular `Localizations.of()` expression is used frequently,
so the `MaterialLocalizations` class provides a convenient shorthand:

<!-- skip -->
```dart
static MaterialLocalizations of(BuildContext context) {
  return Localizations.of<MaterialLocalizations>(context, MaterialLocalizations);
}

/// References to the localized values defined by MaterialLocalizations
/// are typically written like this:

tooltip: MaterialLocalizations.of(context).backButtonTooltip,
```

<a name="defining-class"></a>
### Defining a class for the app's localized resources

Putting together an internationalized Flutter app usually
starts with the class that encapsulates the app's localized values.
The example that follows is typical of such classes.

Complete source code for the [`intl_example`][] for this app.

This example is based on the APIs and tools provided by the
[`intl`][] package.
[An alternative class for the app's localized resources][]
describes [an example][] that doesn't depend on the `intl` package.

The `DemoLocalizations` class contains the app's strings
(just one for the example) translated into the locales
that the app supports.
It uses the `initializeMessages()` function
generated by Dart's [`intl`][] package,
[`Intl.message()`][], to look them up.

<?code-excerpt "intl_example/lib/main.dart (DemoLocalizations)"?>
```dart
class DemoLocalizations {
  DemoLocalizations(this.localeName);

  static Future<DemoLocalizations> load(Locale locale) {
    final String name = locale.countryCode == null || locale.countryCode!.isEmpty
        ? locale.languageCode
        : locale.toString();
    final String localeName = Intl.canonicalizedLocale(name);

    return initializeMessages(localeName).then((_) {
      return DemoLocalizations(localeName);
    });
  }

  static DemoLocalizations of(BuildContext context) {
    return Localizations.of<DemoLocalizations>(context, DemoLocalizations)!;
  }

  final String localeName;

  String get title {
    return Intl.message(
      'Hello World',
      name: 'title',
      desc: 'Title for the Demo application',
      locale: localeName,
    );
  }
}
```

A class based on the `intl` package imports a generated
message catalog that provides the `initializeMessages()`
function and the per-locale backing store for `Intl.message()`.
The message catalog is produced by an [`intl` tool][]
that analyzes the source code for classes that contain
`Intl.message()` calls.  In this case that would just be the
`DemoLocalizations` class.

<a name="adding-language"></a>
### Adding support for a new language

An app that needs to support a language that's not included in
[`GlobalMaterialLocalizations`][] has to do some extra work:
it must provide about 70 translations ("localizations")
for words or phrases and the date patterns and symbols for the
locale.

See the following for an example of how to add
support for the Norwegian Nynorsk language.

A new `GlobalMaterialLocalizations` subclass defines the
localizations that the Material library depends on.
A new `LocalizationsDelegate` subclass, which serves
as factory for the `GlobalMaterialLocalizations` subclass,
must also be defined.

Here's the source code for the complete [`add_language`][] example,
minus the actual Nynorsk translations.

The locale-specific `GlobalMaterialLocalizations` subclass
is called `NnMaterialLocalizations`,
and the `LocalizationsDelegate` subclass is
`_NnMaterialLocalizationsDelegate`.
The value of `NnMaterialLocalizations.delegate`
is an instance of the delegate, and is all
that's needed by an app that uses these localizations.

The delegate class includes basic date and number format
localizations. All of the other localizations are defined by `String`
valued property getters in `NnMaterialLocalizations`, like this:

<?code-excerpt "add_language/lib/nn_intl.dart (Getters)"?>
```dart
@override
String get moreButtonTooltip => r'More';

@override
String get aboutListTileTitleRaw => r'About $applicationName';

@override
String get alertDialogLabel => r'Alert';
```

These are the English translations, of course.
To complete the job you need to change the return
value of each getter to an appropriate Nynorsk string.

The getters return "raw" Dart strings that have an r prefix,
like `r'About $applicationName'`,
because sometimes the strings contain variables with a `$` prefix.
The variables are expanded by parameterized localization methods:

<?code-excerpt "add_language/lib/nn_intl.dart (Raw)"?>
```dart
@override
String get pageRowsInfoTitleRaw => r'$firstRowâ€“$lastRow of $rowCount';

@override
String get pageRowsInfoTitleApproximateRaw =>
    r'$firstRowâ€“$lastRow of about $rowCount';
```

The date patterns and symbols of the locale will also need to
be specified. In the source code, the date patterns and symbols
are defined like this:

{% comment %}
RegEx adds last two lines with commented out code and closing bracket.
{% endcomment %}
<?code-excerpt "add_language/lib/nn_intl.dart (Date)" replace="/  'LLL': 'LLL',/  'LLL': 'LLL',\n  \/\/ ...\n}/g"?>
```dart
const nnLocaleDatePatterns = {
  'd': 'd.',
  'E': 'ccc',
  'EEEE': 'cccc',
  'LLL': 'LLL',
  // ...
}
```

{% comment %}
RegEx adds last two lines with commented out code and closing bracket.
{% endcomment %}
<?code-excerpt "add_language/lib/nn_intl.dart (Date2)" replace="/  ],/  ],\n  \/\/ ...\n}/g"?>
```dart
const nnDateSymbols = {
  'NAME': 'nn',
  'ERAS': <dynamic>[
    'f.Kr.',
    'e.Kr.',
  ],
  // ...
}
```

These will need to be modified for the locale to use the correct
date formatting. Unfortunately, since the `intl` library does
not share the same flexibility for number formatting, the formatting
for an existing locale will have to be used as a substitute in
`_NnMaterialLocalizationsDelegate`:

<?code-excerpt "add_language/lib/nn_intl.dart (Delegate)"?>
```dart
class _NnMaterialLocalizationsDelegate
    extends LocalizationsDelegate<MaterialLocalizations> {
  const _NnMaterialLocalizationsDelegate();

  @override
  bool isSupported(Locale locale) => locale.languageCode == 'nn';

  @override
  Future<MaterialLocalizations> load(Locale locale) async {
    final String localeName = intl.Intl.canonicalizedLocale(locale.toString());

    // The locale (in this case `nn`) needs to be initialized into the custom
    // date symbols and patterns setup that Flutter uses.
    date_symbol_data_custom.initializeDateFormattingCustom(
      locale: localeName,
      patterns: nnLocaleDatePatterns,
      symbols: intl.DateSymbols.deserializeFromMap(nnDateSymbols),
    );

    return SynchronousFuture<MaterialLocalizations>(
      NnMaterialLocalizations(
        localeName: localeName,
        // The `intl` library's NumberFormat class is generated from CLDR data
        // (see https://github.com/dart-lang/intl/blob/master/lib/number_symbols_data.dart).
        // Unfortunately, there is no way to use a locale that isn't defined in
        // this map and the only way to work around this is to use a listed
        // locale's NumberFormat symbols. So, here we use the number formats
        // for 'en_US' instead.
        decimalFormat: intl.NumberFormat('#,##0.###', 'en_US'),
        twoDigitZeroPaddedFormat: intl.NumberFormat('00', 'en_US'),
        // DateFormat here will use the symbols and patterns provided in the
        // `date_symbol_data_custom.initializeDateFormattingCustom` call above.
        // However, an alternative is to simply use a supported locale's
        // DateFormat symbols, similar to NumberFormat above.
        fullYearFormat: intl.DateFormat('y', localeName),
        compactDateFormat: intl.DateFormat('yMd', localeName),
        shortDateFormat: intl.DateFormat('yMMMd', localeName),
        mediumDateFormat: intl.DateFormat('EEE, MMM d', localeName),
        longDateFormat: intl.DateFormat('EEEE, MMMM d, y', localeName),
        yearMonthFormat: intl.DateFormat('MMMM y', localeName),
        shortMonthDayFormat: intl.DateFormat('MMM d'),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  bool shouldReload(_NnMaterialLocalizationsDelegate old) => false;
}
```

For more information about localization strings, see the
[flutter_localizations README][].

Once you've implemented your language-specific subclasses of
`GlobalMaterialLocalizations` and `LocalizationsDelegate`,
you just need to add the language and a delegate instance to your app.
Here's some code that sets the app's language to Nynorsk and
adds the `NnMaterialLocalizations` delegate instance to the app's
`localizationsDelegates` list:

<?code-excerpt "add_language/lib/main.dart (MaterialApp)"?>
```dart
MaterialApp(
  localizationsDelegates: [
    GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
    GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
    NnMaterialLocalizations.delegate, // Add the newly created delegate
  ],
  supportedLocales: [
    const Locale('en', 'US'),
    const Locale('nn'),
  ],
  home: Home(),
),
```

<a name="alternative-internationalization-workflows">
## Alternative internationalization workflows

This section describes different approaches to internationalize
your Flutter application.

<a name="alternative-class"></a>
### An alternative class for the app's localized resources

The previous DemoApp example was defined in terms of the Dart `intl`
package. Developers can choose their own approach for managing
localized values for the sake of simplicity or perhaps to integrate
with a different i18n framework.

Complete source code for the [`minimal`][] app.

In this version of DemoApp the class that contains the app's
localizations, DemoLocalizations, includes all of its translations
directly in per language Maps.


<?code-excerpt "minimal/lib/main.dart (Demo)"?>
```dart
class DemoLocalizations {
  DemoLocalizations(this.locale);

  final Locale locale;

  static DemoLocalizations of(BuildContext context) {
    return Localizations.of<DemoLocalizations>(context, DemoLocalizations)!;
  }

  static Map<String, Map<String, String>> _localizedValues = {
    'en': {
      'title': 'Hello World',
    },
    'es': {
      'title': 'Hola Mundo',
    },
  };

  String get title {
    return _localizedValues[locale.languageCode]!['title']!;
  }
}
```

In the minimal app the `DemoLocalizationsDelegate` is slightly
different. Its `load` method returns a [`SynchronousFuture`][]
because no asynchronous loading needs to take place.

<?code-excerpt "minimal/lib/main.dart (Delegate)"?>
```dart
class DemoLocalizationsDelegate extends LocalizationsDelegate<DemoLocalizations> {
  const DemoLocalizationsDelegate();

  @override
  bool isSupported(Locale locale) => ['en', 'es'].contains(locale.languageCode);

  @override
  Future<DemoLocalizations> load(Locale locale) {
    // Returning a SynchronousFuture here because an async "load" operation
    // isn't needed to produce an instance of DemoLocalizations.
    return SynchronousFuture<DemoLocalizations>(DemoLocalizations(locale));
  }

  @override
  bool shouldReload(DemoLocalizationsDelegate old) => false;

### Using the Dart intl tools

Before building an API using the Dart [`intl`][] package
you'll want to review the `intl` package's documentation.
Here's a summary of the process
for localizing an app that depends on the `intl` package.

The demo app depends on a generated source file called
`l10n/messages_all.dart`, which defines all of the
localizable strings used by the app.

Rebuilding `l10n/messages_all.dart` requires two steps.

 1. With the app's root directory as the current directory,
    generate `l10n/intl_messages.arb` from `lib/main.dart`:

    ```terminal
    $ flutter pub run intl_translation:extract_to_arb --output-dir=lib/l10n lib/main.dart
    ```

    The `intl_messages.arb` file is a JSON format map with one entry for
    each `Intl.message()` function defined in `main.dart`. This
    file serves as a template for the English and Spanish translations,
    `intl_en.arb` and `intl_es.arb`.
    These translations are created by you, the developer.

 2. With the app's root directory as the current directory,
    generate `intl_messages_<locale>.dart` for each
    `intl_<locale>.arb` file and `intl_messages_all.dart`,
    which imports all of the messages files:

    ```terminal
    $ flutter pub run intl_translation:generate_from_arb \
        --output-dir=lib/l10n --no-use-deferred-loading \
        lib/main.dart lib/l10n/intl_*.arb
    ```

    ***Windows does not support file name wildcarding.***
    Instead, list the .arb files that were generated by the
    `intl_translation:extract_to_arb` command.

    ```terminal
    $ flutter pub run intl_translation:generate_from_arb \
        --output-dir=lib/l10n --no-use-deferred-loading \
        lib/main.dart \
        lib/l10n/intl_en.arb lib/l10n/intl_fr.arb lib/l10n/intl_messages.arb
    ```

    The `DemoLocalizations` class uses the generated `initializeMessages()`
    function (defined in `intl_messages_all.dart`)
    to load the localized messages and `Intl.message()` to look them up.
