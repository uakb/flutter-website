## What can I do with DevTools?

Here are some of the things you can do with DevTools:

* Inspect the UI layout and state of a Flutter app.
* Diagnose UI jank performance issues in a Flutter app.
* CPU profiling for a Flutter or Dart app.
* Network profiling for a Flutter app.
* Source-level debugging of a Flutter or Dart app.
* Debug memory issues in a Flutter or Dart
  command-line app.
* View general log and diagnostics information
  about a running Flutter or Dart
  command-line app.
* Analyze code and app size.

We expect you to use DevTools in conjunction with
your existing IDE or command-line based development workflow.
